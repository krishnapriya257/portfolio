   I have created my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which showcases my education, skills, and future learning goals. This project helped me understand the basics of web development, including page structure, styling, and responsive design. Currently, I am learning the fundamentals of Python and C programming, focusing on core programming concepts, problem-solving, and logical thinking. These skills will form the foundation for my future projects in AI, Data Analysis and Machine Learning, as I gradually explore these fields through hands-on practice and small exercises.And in future trying to explore more and to work in many projects.</h3>
