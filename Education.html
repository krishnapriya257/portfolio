   <h3 style="color: white; text-align: center; margin: 40px; padding: 20px; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"> I am currently a first-year B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Rajagiri School of Engineering & Technology. I am building a strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and AI-related concepts to prepare for future projects and learning opportunities. Prior to this, I completed my 12th grade at Government Higher Secondary School, North Paravur, where I developed an interest in technology and problem-solving. I am also exploring online courses and workshops to strengthen my skills in Python, data analysis, and AI fundamentals, with the goal of gradually working on small projects and gaining practical experience.</h3>
